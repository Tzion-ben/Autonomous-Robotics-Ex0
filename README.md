Ex0 - GNSS Raw Measurements

To run the code, you need to execute it sequentially in a Jupyter notebook, section by section.

At the bottom of the file, there is a section for tests. You need to run each test separately because it will create a CSV file and a KML file with the same name each time, and every test will override the previous files. Therefore, run each test one by one and check the files after every test.

To run a new file of yours, you need to execute only the "Run" section.
